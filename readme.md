#### About
Hello HA friends, my name is Jimz011 and I proudly present to you HKI v.1.1
After a two week alpha/beta test the project has matured a great deal and I can now deem it release ready. Homekit Infused is an easy to setup and easy to configure package for Home Assistant which builds a beautiful frontend for you. To set up Homekit Infused all you'd have to do is fill in a few files (which are very easy to understand) and you will be rocking a Homekit style frontend on your mobile phone! Have a good one!
