# About this project
Homekit Infused is a Home Assistant lovelace project designed to mimic, improve and ultimately replace Homekit. Homekit has too much limitations which I think was too bad as it really looks cool if you only have 6 lights :D

Homekit Infused is created with a lot of usability in mind, it is relatively easy to install and even easier to setup, but is still highly customizable for the experienced HA users. My goal was always to create something like Homekit but better AND have it presented to the public as easy to use and install.

Homekit Infused was created as a private project and released to the public as it was requested by many. In the past year the setup has changed quite a bit, not only aesthetically but also codewise. My goal was to make it easier for people to use what I have created without compromising too much on customization that users have made after installing my previous versions of HKI. The setup is still just as 'modular' as it ever was and you will find many improvements over the previous versions if you are an avid user of my setup. New users might find this project very interesting as well, as not only does it give you this wonderful interface, but it will also give you insight on how a bartender (yes that is me) creates code without having any coding knowledge beforehand other than some basic HTML back in the early 2000s.

# Warnings!!!!
Warning:
  - This project is NOT for beginners, if you do not know the basics of lovelace, you probably shouldn't jump on installing this project too fast (however, it is easier to install/configure than ever). If you don't have the basic knowledge, don't want to learn lovelace or simply want to wait before installing this project to get more knowledge about lovelace then I can recommend you to use apps like HassKit or HassApp (they are both free!). These apps are really really easy to use and even looks good. However it isn't that much customizable and well it has a different style to them (even though it is only a slight difference).
  
- People coming from HKI 0.13.3 or below I have some bad news, there is NO upgrade path from those versions. You will have to install it fresh (you probably still want to as this code is imho much much better).
- The icons shown on my videos are from FontAwesome. I use the pro version for my personal use and unfortunately I am not at liberty to share these. I have changed all the icons to and mdi variant for you so you don't have to worry about editing icons yourself.
- Questions asked without reading the documentation have the chance of not being answered. Read before you need help! I will however post video's on YT in the future
- If you use the NEST integration, you probably do NOT want to do a clean install! You might not be able to restore it. This is only a warning! I do not own a NEST and I have no clue on how it works. I mention this advised by some of the followers of this project.
- Using HKI means you MUST have lovelace in YAML mode, what this means is that you can NO LONGER use the UI editor within lovelace. Therefor all the options to do that have been removed. Do NOT try to edit it with the GUI anyways as it will simply not work. If you rely on that specific editor this project is NOT for you!
